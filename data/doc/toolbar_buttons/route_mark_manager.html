<p>
Through the Route Manager <img src="../opencpn/manual/route-button.h.31_tok.dfd02a_w.30.png" class="media" alt="" width="30" height="31" /> OpenCPN can save and load waypoints, routes, tracks and layers using the GPX transfer format. This lets you save your routes and marks so you can have more than the active ones - for example to do route planning, or archive existing data.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> GPX format is supported by a wide variety of programs.</li>
<li class="level1"> You can have as many saved files as you wish, there are no limits on the number of saved files.</li>
<li class="level1"> Use this for passage planning by saving multiple possible routes for a passage.</li>
<li class="level1"> Save routes and tracks for historical-log purposes.</li>
<li class="level1"> Prepare layers as an aid to navigation en route.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>All Navigation Objects</b> on this page, except for “Temporary Layers”, <b>are persistent</b> between sessions. More here: <a href="../advanced_features/navigation_data_backup.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:advanced_features:navigation_data_backup">Navigation Data Backup</a>
<b>All objects visibility</b> is toggled by clicking the “eye” <img src="../opencpn/manual/eye33.h.18_tok.7aec0e_w.24.png" class="media" alt="" width="24" height="18" />, or other icon, to the left of the route-track-waypoint-layers name, on each line. A red X across the “eye” or icon (for marks) means that the object is invisible.  <b>All objects can be sorted</b> by the header in the columns in the Manager. By clicking “Route Name below, the routes will be sorted alphabetically, pressing once again reverses the order. Similar for the column “To”, the destination.  <b>Select multiple objects</b> in the Routes, Tracks, or Waypoints tabs,individually by CTRL + leftclick, or in group by SHIFT + leftclick, for export or deletion.  <b>Double-clicking</b> on a  <b>Waypoint</b>,  <b>Route</b> or  <b>Track</b> brings up the respective Properties dialog.

A small dialog let you choose, if existing marks, included in a route, will also become invisible. When a route is turned visible, all the shared waypoints are also made visible.

<li class="level1">  <b>Plan Speed</b> The overall planned speed for the route. The speed for each leg can be set by going to the waypoint Properties→Description tab for the waypoint that starts the leg, and write in the speed. For example ” VMG=9.7“. [Unfortunately this approach presently excludes writing descriptions for the waypoint. One or the other, be warned!] The Plan Speed value is persistent and will be used for further routes, unless changed. The default value is 6.0 knots.</li>

<li class="level1">  <b>During Passage</b> - Set Route “Active” Route &amp; &amp; time shown as “Local@PC”. If you are simulating this condition you may need to right click on the next WP and pick “Active”. On an ocean passage, after a week of sailing, calculate ETA to the following WP. Set the route as “active” &amp; next WP as “active”. Then, when entering “&gt;”=“now” as Departure Time, all the ETAs are from your real position TO THE NEXT WP, not to the beginning of the route. The ETA to the active waypoint is from Ownship to the WP. Note the Active Waypoint Console.</li>

The lower part of the Route properties dialog now has a  <b>Print Route</b> button. It is possible to first select what features to print before being sent to the normal print routine.

<ul>
<li class="level1">  <b>Extend Route</b>:Extending is possible only when it is obvious, what should be joined with the current route (current=visible in the Dialog). Eligible are all visible route points shared with, or lying nearby to the current route&#039;s endpoint. If there is exactly 1 such point, then it is considered obvious, and the Extend button is enabled. If there are more, some should be hidden before proceeding, until just 1 remains. </li>
<li class="level1"> Routes are extended forward, based on the geographic location, next route point must be very near, as when mouse-extending the route. If the next route point is to far away for extending, just create the joining leg and extend twice.</li>
<li class="level1">  <b>Split Route:</b> For splitting, the split point is selected as the row in the listing. The point-of-split becomes part of both new routes (shared) or tracks (cloned). Original route-track is deleted.</li>
<li class="level1"> Here is a basic example of first splitting then extending. The test route is shown below  * </li>

Pressing the button activates a dialog were an output port is selected. This port does not have to be listed in “Connections” as it is an independent feature. This choice also appears in the right click menu for routes and waypoints. For  <b>Garmin Users</b>, make sure that the ToolBox→GPS→”Use Garmin GRMN-GRMN (Host) mode for Waypoint and Route uploads“ box is ticked. The reason for this is that Garmin units cannot accept route uploads via NMEA0183. This is a “design feature” of all Garmin receivers.  * </li>

<li class="level1">  <b>Import</b>. Import one or more previously saved Routes, or Routes from other gpx compatible applications. It is possible to select and import multiple routes. The default waypoint icon bitmap is a circle. This kicks in if the icon in the imported gpx-file is not recognized.  * Export All, now called “<b>Export All Visible…</b>” Saves all visible routes, waypoints and layers, in one gpx file. This is done through a normal file saving dialog.  * If a Tidal Height Curve Dialog, for an individual tidal station is shown on the screen, the tidal situation for this station will be tabulated along all route points in the route properties dialog. It is essential to enter a departure time and a planned speed. Once “Enter” is pressed the tidal column will show the nearest High or Low water considering the ETA at each waypoint. </li>

<h2>Tracks</h2>

<li class="level1"> The visibility of tracks is controlled by clicking the “eye” on each line. Tracks can be sorted by clicking the column headers.</li>
<li class="level1"> Tracks are extended backward, based on the time-stamp sequence, a track is selected, which ends as the latest one before the start of current track. Tracks are extended as a single segment if they share the extending point. If they ha no common point a new “empty” segment, with no visible track, is added. Joining two tracks (i.e. extending a track) results in just track one remaining. It may look like two tracks but the Route Manager treats it as a single track.</li>
<li class="level1"> “Merge Selected Tracks” is an alternative to “Extend Track”, where tracks are joined. The difference is that Merged tracks are visibly joined by straight track-lines. Read on for instructions on merging tracks.</li>
<li class="level1"> If you have ever hit the Track icon by mistake, or closed down OpenCPN in the middle of a passage, you know that it&#039;s very frustrating it is, to have a voyage split up in a number of different tracks that does not come together.</li>
<li class="level1"> This can be fixed. Just select any number of tracks in the Track tab of the Route Manager window, right click the mouse to bring up the context menu, and choose to Merge Selected Tracks. The selected tracks will be merged in chronological order, with the track properties (name, color etc) of the resulting track keeping those of the earliest track in the selection. </li>

<li class="level1"> Pick one of the options, it reduces the amount of points in an existing track while maintaining the specified maximum error between the original track and the reduced track. Testing on an old OpenCPN track or an imported track, with an error setting of 10 or 20 meters tracks, will, in many cases, reduce the size to less than half and one can&#039;t really see the difference.</li>
