Comment: Comment: wrt code duplication,
 plugins/demo_pi_sample's copy is just for illustrative purposes.
 see http://opencpn.org/ocpn/flyspray/index.php?do=details&task_id=725
 .
 wrt being an embedded library,  It does not exist in elsewhere in Debian;
 the code here has been  specifically tailored/reworked by the OpenCPN
 lead author and is  maintained within the OpenCPN source tree.
 .
 Samuel Blackburn's original source license:  "You can use it any way you
 like."  More recent (2010) license statement from Samuel:  "It is BSD
 license, do with it what you will"  (and what Dave's decided to do
 with it is make our copy of it GPLv2+)

Comment:Dave Register (OpenCPN lead author) wrote:
 "We could use libgdal, with what I would call "moderate"
 effort, with some loss of functionality. There are
 good reasons not to. libgdal is very capable, but  not
 optimum for dynamic GUI based systems like ours.  Its
 great for generating static data from S57 cells.
 .
 I tweaked some of the code to compile on Windows, eliminate
 redundancy, reduce memory footprint, fix some obvious bugs
 present in the version I started with, and add call backs to
 support Progress Dialogs on SENC creation. In theory, these
 fixes should go upstream to GDAL.  In practice, though.....  .
 IMHO, this kind of improvement for a specific application
 should not block debian repo inclusion.  Otherwise we wear a
 ball and chain, and innovation is stifled.
 .
 Thanks Dave"
