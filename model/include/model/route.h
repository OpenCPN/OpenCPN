/**
 * Represents a navigational route in the navigation system.
 *
 * The Route class manages an ordered list of RoutePoints that define a

 *
 * A Route can be:
 * - Active or inactive for navigation
 * - Visible or hidden on the chart
 * - Temporary or persistent
 * - Part of a layer or standalone
 *
 * The class supports various route operations like adding, inserting, or
 * removing waypoints, calculating segment distances, and handling waypoint
 * sharing between multiple routes. It also maintains navigation-related
 * attributes like planned speeds, departure times, and style attributes for
 * rendering.
