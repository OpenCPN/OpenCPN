/**
 * Sound backend based on wxWidget's wxSound class. On Linux, this seems
 * to be broken -- at a minimum it requires the old OSS API which on
 * pulseaudio platforms means to have the osspd service running. Even so,
 * there seems to be many quirks here.
 *
 * However, the backend might possibly work on MacOS and/or Windows.
 * Supports synchronous and asynchronous mode.
