## Hello world

IXWebSocket is a C++ library for WebSocket client and server development. It has minimal dependencies (no boost), is very simple to use and support everything you'll likely need for websocket dev (SSL, deflate compression, compiles on most platforms, etc...). HTTP client and server code is also available, but it hasn't received as much testing.

It is been used on big mobile video game titles sending and receiving tons of messages since 2017 (iOS and Android). It was tested on macOS, iOS, Linux, Android, Windows and FreeBSD. Note that the MinGW compiler is not supported at this point. Two important design goals are simplicity and correctness.

A bad security bug affecting users compiling with SSL enabled and OpenSSL as the backend was just fixed in newly released version 11.0.0. Please upgrade ! (more details in the [https://github.com/machinezone/IXWebSocket/pull/250](PR).

Interested? Go read the [docs](https://machinezone.github.io/IXWebSocket/)! If things don't work as expected, please create an issue on GitHub, or even better a pull request if you know how to fix your problem.

IXWebSocket is actively being developed, check out the [changelog](https://machinezone.github.io/IXWebSocket/CHANGELOG/) to know what's cooking. If you are looking for a real time messaging service (the chat-like 'server' your websocket code will talk to) with many features such as history, backed by Redis, look at [cobra](https://github.com/machinezone/cobra).

IXWebSocket client code is autobahn compliant beginning with the 6.0.0 version. See the current [test results](https://bsergean.github.io/autobahn/reports/clients/index.html). Some tests are still failing in the server code.

Starting with the 11.0.8 release, IXWebSocket should be fully C++11 compatible.

## Alternative libraries

There are plenty of great websocket libraries out there, which might work for you. Here are a couple of serious ones.

* [websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp) - C++
* [beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast) - C++
* [libwebsockets](https://libwebsockets.org/) - C
* [ÂµWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) - C
* [wslay](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/wslay) - C

[uvweb](https://github.com/bsergean/uvweb) is a library written by the IXWebSocket author which is built on top of [uvw](https://github.com/skypjack/uvw), which is a C++ wrapper for [libuv](https://libuv.org/). It has more dependencies and does not support SSL at this point, but it can be used to open multiple connections within a single OS thread thanks to libuv.

To check the performance of a websocket library, you can look at the [autoroute](https://github.com/bsergean/autoroute) project.
