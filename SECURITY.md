## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security related issue in OpenCPN, please report it by opening an issue in our [public tracker](https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues), however please do not publicly post exploits with harmful consequences (data destruction, etc.) and coordinate the handover of such material with the maintainers of the project.
