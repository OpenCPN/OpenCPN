= Debugging messages - Data Monitor

From 5.12 the internal messaging could be debugged using the Data Monitor.
The monitor can be started

. From the menu as Tools | Data Monitor
. Using the E shortcut on the chart canvas
. Using the chart canvas context menu, under Debug (must be enabled in GUI settings)

The monitor is a mostly self explanatory GUI program which supports displaying
messages, applying all sorts of filters and also logging messages to file.

The monitor replaces the former NMEA debugger
One difference is that it supports all sorts of messages.
Another is that it is oriented to events generated when messages are recieved or
sent.

== The main window
Some typical log lines might look like: image:monitor.png[]

=== Timestamp - 1
The time when opencpn received the message. This is printed with milliseconds,
but operating system buffering tends to delay and deliver messages in bursts
which often is visible as common time stamps for more than one message.


=== Message directions - 2

The old debugger basically just had input or output messages. The new has four
directions. In the monitor, they are marked like:

⇤ An input message. This is a low level event, before message processing. All
messages generates an input event, even if they are not otherwise recognized.

← A handled message.
Generated if and when the input message is recognized and further processing
is applied,

→ An output message.

↔ An internal message, typically sent from the core to plugins.
Could also be for example a message exchanged between plugins.

=== Filtering status - 3

After being received filtering is applied to the message. The result
is displayed in the monitor:

x Message contains errors and cannot be processed.

✓ The message passes all filters

⇥ The message is received and accepted, but not forwarded to output channel(s)

| The message is blocked on input  and not processed in any way.

=== Interface - 4

The interface used to receive or send message, actual formatting depends on
the underlying transport. The *Internal* interface refers to messages sent from
core to plugin or, in some cases, between plugins.


=== Event type - 5

All messages have attributes related to how they are processed in the
event system.
The most important is the message key.
This is the overall, common message identifier used for everything from
NMEA0183 to internal messages.

=== The rest...
is depending on actual message type. In general, it's the message content in some
printable representation.

== Logging formats

Logging can be done using three formats.

1. The default format resembles the visible log on screen.
It is aimed for human consumption.

2. The VDR format is based on the spec in
xref:vdr::log_format.adoc[specification].
The main  purpose of this format is that it eventually shall be possible to
replay using the xref:vdr::index.adoc[VDR plugin].
However, at the time of writing this is yet not implemented, tracked in
https://github.com/rgleason/vdr_pi/issues/108[VDR bug #108] +
 +
This format is also suitable for importing logs into spreadsheets
like MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc.

3. The CSV format is a simplified VDR format using | as field separator
targetting traditional, command line post processing tools.
