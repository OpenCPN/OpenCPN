= Coding Guidelines

== Guidelines for Submitters

=== General Principles

Follow the https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html[Google Style Guide]
besides exceptions found in this document for all `C++` code.

Be aware that existing code may not always reflect current best practices or project preferences.
The codebase evolves, and what was once standard may now be outdated. Refer to this document for up-to-date guidelines.

=== Naming Conventions

. File names: use `snake_case`. Use `.h` for headers. Keep reasonably short.
. Variable names: use `lower_case_names`.
. Class member variables: use `m_lower_case`.
. Class and methods names: use `PascalCase`. Avoid upper case acronyms, use OcpnFoo and NmeaFoo rather than OCPNFoo and NMEAFoo.
. Constants: Pascal case + a 'k' prefix: `kSomeConstantValue`

=== C++ Practices

Use C++ standard library components over wxWidgets and old style C equivalents:

[options="header"]
|===
| Avoid (wxWidgets, C) | Use Instead (C++ Standard Library) |
| `wxMutex` | `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` |
| `wxHashTable` | `std::unordered_map` |
| `wxList`, `wxArray` | `std::vector` or other STL containers |
| `wxThread` | `std::thread`, `std::async` |
| `wxString` | `std::string` or `std::wstring` |
| `open()`   | `std::ifstream`, `std::ofstream`, etc |
|===

=== Memory Management

. Do not use raw pointers and `new`/`delete`.
  The exception is when raw pointers are required by external libraries
  like wxWidgets.
. Use `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` for better memory management.

=== String Handling

. Use double-quoted strings for unicode strings.
. Do not use `_T()` or `wxT()` macros.
See link:++https://docs.wxwidgets.org%2F3.2%2Fgroup__group__funcmacro__string.html%23ga437ea6ba615b75dac8603e96ec864160++[wxWidgets string guidelines].

=== Exception handling
OpenCPN is compiled with exceptions enabled to handle third party libraries.
However, most of OpenCPN is not  exception safe. Thus:

. Do not throw exceptions.
. When using code which throws exceptions these should be caught as soon as possible

=== Code Documentation

. Document code in doxygen format,
  see https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html[doxygen manual]
. Almost everything is documented in the header files.
. Omit `@brief` and `@details` tags. The first sentence automatically becomes the brief description.
. Avoid redundant phrases like "This class is..."
. Test generated documentation locally. See `manual` sub-directory.

For an extensive example see
https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/blob/master/model/include/model/rest_server.h[rest_server.h],
results in the http://opencpn.github.io/OpenCPN/api-docs/classAbstractRestServer.html[API docs]

=== Error Handling and Logging

. Use appropriate logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) consistently.
. Don't silently fail or ignore errors.
. Provide meaningful i18n error messages and context.

=== Code Refactoring

. When working with existing code, gradually refactor to comply with coding guidelines.
. Do not submit large PRs that refactor a lot of code changes.

=== Localization and Internationalization

. Use the gettext macro `_()` for user-visible strings that need translation.
.. Do not use `_()` for log file messages and internal strings.
. Add new source files containing translatable strings in `po/POTFILES.in`.
. Maintainers run the following commands before each release. Do not run them in your pull requests.
.. `make pot-update` - Scans source files and updates the template (`.pot`) file.
.. `make po-update` - Updates all language files (`.po`) with new strings from template, to merge new strings into existing language files.

[options="header", cols="50,50"]
|===
| Avoid | Use Instead
| `mode = "Auto";` | `mode = _("Auto");`
| `msg = _("File") + " " + _("not found");` | `msg = _("File not found");`
| `msg = _("Found") + wxString::Format(" %d ", count) + _("errors");` | `msg = wxString::Format(_("Found %d errors"), count);`
|===

== Code Formatting

=== C/C++

The sources have a uniform coding formatting based on the
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Formatting[Google Style].

The style is defined in the _.clang-format_ file which when used
by https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html[clang-format] produces a
correctly formatted source file.

Since the 5.10 release all source file modifications must be processed by
clang-format to be accepted. The recommended way to do this is using a git
pre-commit hook which applies formatting when committing changes

To do this, just install the pre-commit program from https://pre-commit.com/:

    $ pip install pre-commit

and then, in the project top directory

    $ pre-commit install

which will pick up the configuration from _.pre-commit-config.yaml_ which is
part of the project.

=== CMake

Cmake file uses formatting defined by the _.cmake-format.yaml_ which when used
with https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format[cmake-format] produces
correctly formatted files. This has been applied to all _cmake/*.cmake_ files
and CMakeLists.txt.

=== Using clang-format

clang is part of the llvm tools. These are usually installed using package
managers like choco (Windows), brew (MacOS) or apt (Debian/Ubuntu).

To format a C, C++ or header file with clang-format with the project's default
configuration use:

    clang-format -i  <filename>

=== Using  cmake-format

Install cmake-format as described in
https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format[]. To format a single file use

    cmake-format -i  <filename>

=== Editor and IDE configuration

There is a  _.editorconfig_ file in the top directory.
This file could be used by most editors to define basic settings.

There are no standard configurations available for IDEs like Visual Studio
Code, Eclipse or CLion.

== Guidelines for Reviewers

=== Performance and Compatibility

. Ensure changes do not reduce performance.
. Verify existing functionality and plugin compatibility are maintained.

=== Cross-Platform Considerations

. Check for consistency across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
. Be aware of platform-specific behaviors, especially for UI elements.

=== Display Settings

. Consider different display settings (e.g., scaled displays, dark modes).
. Plugins should be High DPI Display Responsive.

=== Version Control Best Practices

. Write clear, concise commit messages.
. Keep commits focused and atomic (one logical change per commit).
