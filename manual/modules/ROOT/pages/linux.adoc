= Compiling on Linux
image::opencpn_dev_linux_0.png[width=50]

== Documented platforms

The documentation here covers Debian/Ubuntu and Flatpak. Debian .deb
packages and Flatpaks are the primary deployment platforms for Linux.
It is certainly possible to compile OpenCPN on other Linux distributions
by adapting these instructions.

The instructions are based on the files in the _ci/_ directory, at the
time of writing _ci/generic_build_debian.sh_ and
_ci/generic_build_flatpak.sh_. These files which are continously tested
is the ultimate source for how to build on Linux.

[[build_debian]]
== Debian/Ubuntu

=== 1. Download source code
    $ git clone git://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN.git
    $ cd OpenCPN

=== 2. Install build dependencies

    $ sudo apt install devscripts equivs
    $ sudo mk-build-deps -i -r ci/control
    $ sudo apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install -f

Notes:

  * On Debian Buster and Ubuntu Bionic it is possible to build OpenCPN linked
    against gtk2 or gtk3. The default alternative is to use gtk2.
  * The build setup is generally updated for Debian and Ubuntu LTS
    releases.

=== 3. Optional: Remove old installation

    $ sudo apt-get remove opencpn


=== 4. Build it

We'll build everything in a subdirectory to keep the codebase clean
(easier to catch changes).

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Notes:

Default install dir is /usr/local, this can be changed by providing
the appropriate option to cmake:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

_cmake_ is only required when building source code for the first time,
then running _make_ is enough even if the source code is updated.

=== 5. Install it or create a package

    $ sudo make install

Or, to create a .deb package:

    $ make package


== Flatpak

=== 1. Install flatpak

Install flatpak and flatpak-builder as described in https://flatpak.org/setup/[].

=== 2. Install runtime and SDK

At the time of writing version 20.08 is used. Check
_flatpak/org.opencpn.OpenCPN.yaml_ for the version actually used, look for
_runtime-version:_. Install the proper runtime and Sdk, for example:

    $ sudo flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//20.08
    $ sudo flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk//20.08

=== 3. Build and install:

    $ cd build
    $ make -f ../flatpak/Makefile build

The makefile will build the flatpak version and also install it.

=== 4. Run

    $ flatpak run org.opencpn.OpenCPN

=== 5. Debugging

The flatpak'ed OpenCPN runs in a sandbox, so specialized debugging techniques
must be applied.
See  https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/debugging.html[The flatpak site]

== Compiling for Raspberry Pi (RPi)

From RPi 4 the board has resources enough to run a native build, which is
performed according to the instructions for xref:#build_debian[Debian].
At the time of writing, it is unclear if this is possible on a rPI 3
with 1MB of RAM.

NOTE: Fixme

== Fedora

To install the dependencies required to build OpenCPN from source on Fedora (Tested on 38), run the following command 

```
sudo dnf install wxGTK-devel cmake gcc-c++ git glew-devel openssl-devel libcurl-devel libarchive-devel elfutils-libelf-devel redhat-lsb-core libusb1-devel
```

Then use whichever build method you prefer.

== IDEs

=== https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code]

Visual Studio Code provides very decent support for C++ development.
Install the language support for C++, cmake and Git and open the root
folder of the OpenCPN source tree.

=== https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/[Eclipse]

The current version 2021-06 (4.20.0) has native support for cmake projects.
It is thus possible to just create a new CMake project based on current
sources out of the box. There is thus no need to use the
unmaintained `cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ../` cmake
project generation.

However, this version suffers from
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=400073[] which makes it
impossible to index the sources. Without indexing, eclipse does not
add that much value.

=== https://www.kdevelop.org/[KDevelop]

Current version  5.6.2 has native support for CMake project. There
is thus no need to use the unmaintained
`cmake -G "KDevelop3 - Unix Makefiles" ../` cmake project generation
tools.

=== https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/[CLion]

There are some reports without details from users using CLion for OpenCPN
development. CLion is commercial software, but are giving out
free licenses for open source development in certain cases.

=== https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/[wxFormBuilder]

Initially, many of the dialogs was developed using
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/[wxFormBuilder].
However, the sources has since long been patched "manually" and it is
not possible to maintain them using this tool which basically has
been abandoned in the project.

=== Running inside an IDE

In order to be able to run OpenCPN from inside the IDE
installed data needs to be copied to the build/ folder according to

  $ cd build
  $ for d in gshhs s57data tcdata; do; cp -ar ../data/$d .; done
  $ mkdir uidata
  $ cp ../src/bitmaps/*.xml ../src/bitmaps/*.png ../src/bitmaps/*.svg uidata
  $ cp ../data/authors.html ../data/license.html .

opencpn should be run with the -p options which sets it into 'portable'
mode and therefore looks in the location the 'opencpn' executable is run
from, i.e. the 'build' directory.

Creating a working IDE setup is somewhat complex, and the details varies
between different IDEs.
