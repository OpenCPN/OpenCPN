"Variation is the angle between true and magnetic north.\n"

"\t(+- 90 at the magnetic poles)\n"
"Field Strength is the magnetic field in nano tesla from\n"

"The plotted lines are similar to a topographic map.  The space between them "

"The World Magnetic Model Plugin was written by Pavel Kalian and extended by "
